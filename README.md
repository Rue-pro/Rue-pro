### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer based in Russia. I really like development with React.

I'm currently working on an private app, which helps to make documents for bankruptcy proceeding and also you can choose trustee in bankruptcy, who will help you with bankruptcy proceeding.

In my spare time I'm working on an ui-kit using React.
